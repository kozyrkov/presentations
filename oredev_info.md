# Invitation to speak at Øredev
Hi Cassie! I hope you're well during these hard times.
My name is Johnny Dang, and I'm part of the programme committee of Øredev, an annual developer conference normally help in Malmö, Sweden.
I couldn't find your email anywhere on the Internet, so I thought I'd give creating a pull request a try to get in contact with you.
Your Medium articles have been very inspiring and therefore I would like to invite to come and speak at Øredev.
If you're interested to know more about Øredev, then I'd love to get in contact with you in a more convenient conversation medium.
My email is johnny dot dang at jayway dot com

Hope you have a great day,

Johnny Dang
